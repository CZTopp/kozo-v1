""Forecasting Revenue and Case Study #1: Projecting Shark VR’s Revenue""","

Tony’s uncle Wayne Bruce gave him $100k to start his company in December of 2012. Wayne Bruce owns 10% of the company, resulting in a valuation of $1 million.

Case Study #1: Completing the Revenue Forecast Tab (called Step 2 Revenue Forecast):
 
The date is January 1st of 2013. Your friend Tony Shark approaches you and wants you to help him forecast his revenue estimates from 2013 through 2022. Use the below assumptions to populate quarterly revenue forecasts for 2013-2018, and annual forecasts from 2019-2022. 

1. The two revenue line items should be called License Revenue and Maintenance Revenue. 

1.1: Each license comes with a recurring mandatory maintenance revenue portion equal to 20% of the license contract value. 

1.2: Seasonality for license sales is as follows: Q4 accounts for 50% of revenue for the year, Q2 is 30%  of revenue for the year, Q1 and Q3 are at 10% each.

2. Assume no revenue in 2013 as the company is still developing its product.

3. 2014 expects to sell 1,200 licenses at $100 each plus 20% mandatory maintenance every year (regardless of when the customer buys it in the calendar year). No churn (meaning no customer turnover in 2014).

4. 2015 expects to sell 700% more licenses than 2014 for $100 each plus the 20% annual maintenance. Assume churn of 5% of customers from the previous year.

5. 2016 expects to sell 800% more licenses than 2015 for $100 each. Churn of 3% from customers that bought in previous years. 

6. 2017 is a phenomenal growth year and the company expects to sell 900% more licenses than 2016 for $100 each. Churn of 2% from customers now in previous years.

7. In 2018, new competitors are winning/taking away customers from Shark Virtual Reality. The company expects to sell only 500% more licenses at the new, lower price of $95 each. Churn jumps to 5% of previous years’ customers, given new VR technology vendors for customers to choose from. 

8. Forecast 2019 through 2022 by decreasing License revenue growth by 200% annually in 2019 and another 200% decrease in 2020 and keeping it constant at 50% year over year growth in 2021 and also 50% year over year growth in 2022 (as the company’s growth stabilizes). Keep churn constant at 5% of previous years’ customers. Keep the new price of $95 constant from 2019-2022.

9. Forecast 2019-2022 Maintenance growth by calculating the % change year-over year in your quarterly sales allocation chart.

How Hedge Funds & Mutual Funds Model and Value Shark VR (Case #9 and #10)""","
Click HERE for a video explanation of the questions for Case #9","
Case Study #9: The Date is now January 10th of 2018 and you work for a hedge fund. 

Your portfolio manager at the hedge fund that you work at is interested in investing in Shark Virtual Reality Software as either a short or as a long. She says she is willing to pay a PEG of 1.5x and P/R of 10x on estimated 2019 earnings growth and revenue. Using the Step 7 tab you have already built, what should be the average target price in 2019? Please don't forget to discount your target price to 2018 using the WACC you used in the DCF Exercise. If the stock is now at $400, how much upside (or downside) do you predict there is to your target price?

Section 51: 
How Hedge Funds & Mutual Funds Model and Value Shark VR (Case #9 and #10)""","
Click HERE for a video explanation of the questions for Case #10","
Case Study #10: the date is January 11th of 2018 and you work for a mutual fund.

Your manager is interested in potentially investing in Shark Virtual Reality Software. However, he says he doesn't know much about the valuation of the company. He is willing to pay a PEG of 1x on estimated 2022 earnings growth. 

Additionally, we know that the mutual fund portfolio manager is more value focused and less aggressive on the growth forecasts than a hedge fund manager. Change the long-term growth rate from 2% to 1%. Take the average of the PEG of 1x price target, and the DCF implied price per share.

Using the Step 7 tab you have already built, what should be the target price in 2022? Should he start a long position?
